WARNING: This Repo is a Work in Progress

Please read carefully before using these scripts and configurations.

This repository is subject to daily changes, and I am still actively learning how to do a lot of this. While I am committed to improving the code, I cannot guarantee that it will work perfectly or that it won’t cause any unintended issues.
A Few Things to Keep in Mind:

I follow a chaotic and experimental coding style—this means that some parts of the code may not be as clean or standardized as you might expect.

If you decide to use my scripts and software, proceed with caution. If you trust them and are comfortable with the fact that they’re a work in progress, I’d recommend you first familiarize yourself with relevant documentation to better understand what you’re working with.

I am not the ideal source for best practices—while I am constantly learning and improving, I’m still figuring out a lot of things myself.

Useful Resources for Learning:

If you want to dig deeper into how things are supposed to work in Debian, the official documentation and support resources are a good place to start:

Debian Installers README Files
Debian Website (for deeper dives into configurations, etc.)

I cannot emphasize enough: if you're not comfortable experimenting, it’s better to err on the side of caution and follow trusted guides. I’m still learning, and things may break.
